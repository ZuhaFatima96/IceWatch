# IceWatch (In Progress)
Glacial Lake Outburst Flood (GLOF) Prediction System Using Deep Learning
# Project Overview:
This project presents an AI-based early warning system designed to predict potential Glacial Lake Outburst Floods (GLOFs), using environmental data, machine learning, and real-time monitoring. Inspired by the 2022 floods, which brought significant devastation to our region, this system aims to reduce the impact of such natural disasters by providing timely warnings.
# Problem Statement:
With increasing global temperatures, glacial lakes are expanding, raising the risk of outburst floods that can severely impact communities and infrastructure. Traditional methods of monitoring are limited in predictive capability, making it challenging to act before a flood occurs. This project seeks to fill this gap by leveraging AI to enhance predictive accuracy for GLOFs, potentially providing early alerts that could mitigate loss of life and property damage.
